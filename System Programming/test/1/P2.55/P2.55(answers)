*As the show-bytes program executes, it prints pointer and hexadecimal value of the int value requested. 
 Following the result, the computer puts the least significant byte within lowest address. This is called
"little-endian" order usually operated in Intel CPU. On the other hand, other computers such as Mac, Sun 
put the least significant byte within highest address. Therefore, the result would be 
(0x00 0x00 0x3d 0x6d).
