<Description>
Given a oating-point format with a k-bit exponent and an n-bit fraction, write formulas for the exponent
E, significand M, the fraction f, and the value V for the quantities that follow. In addition, describe the
bit representation.

A. The number 7.0
B. The largest odd integer that can be represented exactly
C. The reciprocal of the smallest positive normalized value

<Answer>

A. 7.0 has E(exponent)=2, M(significand)=1.112, f(fraction)=0.112, and V=7.
   Therefore, the exponent-bits is 100...01 and the fraction-bits is 1100....0.

B. The largest odd integer will be E = n, M = 1.11....1(2) = 2-2^(-n), f = 0.11....1(2) = 1 - 2^(-n), 
   and v = 2^(n+1) -1. The exponent in the binary representation is n + 2^(k-1) -1. 
   The bit representation of the fraction is 11....11.(The integer has a binary representation consisiting of n+1 ones).

C. The reciprocal of the smallest positive normalized value is V = 2^2^(k-1) -2, E = 2^(k-1) -2, M = 1, and f = 0.
   Therefore, the bit representation of the exponent is 11…101. The fraction bit is 00…00.
